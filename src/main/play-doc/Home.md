# ConductR Documentation %PLAY_VERSION%

ConductR is a solution for managing Lightbend Reactive Platform applications across a cluster of machines. It is reactive from the ground up thus enabling operations to provide the resiliency required to unleash the full benefits of the Lightbend Reactive Platform in their organization.

Please refer to the [getting started page](https://www.lightbend.com/product/conductr/developer) if you simply want to download ConductR and have it run on your local machine for non-production purposes.

As an operator you can directly head over to the [[Operations guide|Install]]. To get started as a developer go to the [[Developers quick start guide|DevQuickStart]].

If you want to first get an overview of ConductR head over to the [[General|Overview]] section.
